# Reece Peters' CSE374 Portfolio

## Weekly Work

- Week 1: turns vowels in an input phrase into a vodel
    - see `work/reecep81/vodeler.c`
- Week 2: takes in a text input and a string to look for, then, outputs the letters in that string found in the document with other characters omitted.
    - see `work/reecep81/secretmessage.c`
- Week 3: takes in a string of integers, then, outputs a string which represents the heapified version of that string. Also made a debugging puzzle.
    - see `work/reecep81/heapify.c`
    - see `work/reecep81/debugpuzzle.c`
- Week 4: implements a HashMap in c. Also used for my extra credit project after some improvements made later.
    - see `work/reecep81/hmapper.c`
- Week 5: implements a PriorityQueue in c. 
    - see `work/reecep81/priorityq.c`
    - see `work/reecep81/priorityq.h`
    - see `work/reecep81/priorityq_application.c`
- Week 6: implements a Prime checker for integers in c and assembly.
    - see `work/reecep81/primcheck.c`
    - see `work/reecep81/asmprim.s`
- Week 7: implements a shell script which converts a matrix txt document into a latex formatted array and makes a triangle classifier.
    - see `work/reecep81/lplatex`
    - see `work/reecep81/tricheck.c`
    - see `test.txt`
- Week 8: checks the previous triangle classifier for correctness.
    - see `work/reecep81/tricheck2.c`
    - see `work/reecep81/trilib.c`
    - see `work/reecep81/trilib.h`
    - see `work/reecep81/testtri.c`
    - see `work/reecep81/myfuzz.sh`
    - see `work/reecep81/genfuzz.c`

## Other projects

- As a part of my Extra Credit project I implemented a Hash Map a week before we covered most of that material in class, and in doing so, implemented my own LinkedList, Hashing Function, and resizing feature (a doubling version which is best for the efficiency using a load factor).
    - see `work/reecep81/hmapper.c` 

## Reflections and feedback

- This quarter I learned that certain invariants I assumed about programming langauges weren't actually true. Things like automatically allocating and freeing data, returning multiple things from a function, having a generic type, and so much more.
- I have a TON more insight not only into how certain low level langauges actually work, but also how the hardware itself functions, and why certain common programming style things are the way they are.
- My biggest piece of criticism for this class is that I absolutely hate the extra credit system.
    - First, it doesn't make sense as calling it extra credit. If your grade is limited to a 3.4 maximum without doing the extra credit, then it's not "extra" credit, but actual credit in the class. The title of extra credit only obfuscates that these assignments are necessary to get good grades in the class. After all, EVERY assignment is optional if you choose not to do it (and don't get more points in the process). This could be called an "optional illusion".
    - I dislike how the extra credit is ill-formatted as well. For the assignments this is totally fine (in fact I love the freedom associated with it), but when you make an extra credit assignment just as ill-structured, it opens the door for overwork hoping that your "extra special" project is sufficient. For this reason, most of the extra credit projects will take much more effort and time than what should be reasonably required to achieve that credit since it's up to the discretion of the student. In my personal experience, my extra credit project took over 30 hours of thinking, testing, bug fixing, and coding.
    - I would suggest revising this into a singular overarching project over the course of the class where it could account for the extra 0.6 of the GPA. It could be due at the end of the quarter but assigned from day 1. This gives the same low pressure environment and gives the student freedom to do what they want, but alleviates the multiplicative pressure of doing many of these projects, the optional illusion, and gives the student something to focus on specifically for the last few weeks of class.
- Other than that, I loved the format of the class. Truly a unique experience and wokring in git exclusively was great practice. I probably learned 90% of what I'll bring to industry in this class alone. I liked the diatribes and rants, and I generally think you're a great instructor.
